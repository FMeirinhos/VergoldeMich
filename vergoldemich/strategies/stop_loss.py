    A stop-loss order is an order placed with a broker to sell a security
    when it reaches a certain price. Stop loss orders are designed to
    limit an investorâ€™s loss on a position in a security. Although most
    investors associate a stop-loss order with a long position, it can also
    protect a short position, in which case the security gets bought if it
    trades above a defined price.
